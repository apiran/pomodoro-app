# Pomodoro Timer

A simple Pomodoro timer application built with Python and Tkinter. This application helps you manage your time more effectively by breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features

- **Visual Countdown**: Watch the time tick away with a visual countdown.
- **Session Tracking**: Keep track of your completed work sessions with check marks.
